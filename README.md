# VisTheSpire
Visualize run data from Slay The Spire!

[Give it a try here!](https://helloimfrei.shinyapps.io/VisTheSpire/)

Upload a zipped 'runs' folder of your save data, and the app handles the rest.

Planned features include a variety of useful visualiztions to analyze why Gremlin Nob turns you into a fine paste every run.

Get started:
1. Navigate to your game directory (open Steam > right click Slay The Spire in your library > Manage > Browse local files)
2. Compress the runs folder into a zip. Don't rename it! (Mac: right click the runs folder and select 'Compress' on Mac, or Windows: right click > 7Zip > Add to runs.zip)
3. Upload your .zip to the app, and you're good to go!
4. Prepare to be deeply humbled upon seeing your win rate :(
