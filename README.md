# VisTheSpire
Visualize run data from Slay The Spire!
Upload a zipped 'runs' folder of your save data, and the app handles the rest. Planned features include a variety of useful visualiztions to analyze what makes your runs suck or succeed. 

Get started:
1. Navigate to your game directory (open Steam > right click Slay The Spire in your library > Manage > Browse local files)
2. Make a copy of your runs folder, and compress it into a zip. Don't rename it! (Mac: right click a <ins>copy</ins> of the folder and select 'Compress' on Mac, or Windows: right click > 7Zip > Add to runs.zip)
